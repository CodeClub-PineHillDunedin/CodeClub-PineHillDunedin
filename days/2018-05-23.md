## Learning fundamentals

Based on what we want to do, we can decide on some end goals and some ways to get there.

We might not all want to do the same things but we can share some steps on the way and help each other.

## Scratch!

For this week, we started with some Scratch basics and the [Rock Band](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/rock-band/) Scratch project. All of us signed up for Scratch (does everyone remember their logins?) and we created a stage, added some sprites and made them play sounds when clicked. This introduced some fundamentals of Scratch, as well as giving some of our younger learners a chance to learn how to right-click on the school Chromebooks.

Chris was very happy to find that Scratch worked fine on the Chromebooks, even if it did not work on the big screen TV nor the Mac laptop.
