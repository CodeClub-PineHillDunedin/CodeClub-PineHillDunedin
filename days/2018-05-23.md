# Rock Band - 23rd May 2018

Thanks for coming!

## Goals

* Creativity
* Learning
* Coding

## Who's here?

On a cold and rainy day, eleven students came to our first CodeClub! We should have mentioned in the school newsletter that CodeClub is targeted at students age 9 and up - at Pine Hill School this means students in the Senior Learning Team (who are all age 8 and above).

## Why are we here

What do you want to do?

* Make a game?
 * What sort of game?
* Program a robot?
 * What to do?
* Build a device?
* Make a website?

Lots of us wanted to make a game, and lots of people talked about learning for inspiration or identity. One student told us that his grandfather had programmed the traffic lights for New Zealand ... That has to be one of the most used programs in the country!

## What’s in your toolkit?

* Who’s written a program?
* Who’s made something in Scratch?
* Programmed a computer?
* Built in LEGO?
* Made a website?
* Played Minecraft?

Some of us had already played with Scratch before, and lots of us with Scratch Jr also. Most of us had played Minecraft, worked with blocks like LEGO, and everyone had used a computer.

## Learning fundamentals

Based on what we want to do, we decided on some end goals (first steps to make some games) and ways to get there.

We might not all want to do the same things but we can share some steps on the way and help each other!

## Scratch!

For this week, we started with some Scratch basics and the [Rock Band](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/rock-band/) Scratch project. All of us signed up for Scratch (does everyone remember their logins?) and we created a stage, added some sprites and made them play sounds when clicked. This introduced some fundamentals of Scratch, as well as giving some of our younger learners a chance to learn how to right-click on the school Chromebooks.

Chris was very happy to find that Scratch worked fine on the Chromebooks, even if it did not work on the big screen TV nor the Mac laptop.
